\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
A common control objective for mobile robots involves tracking a trajectory in the space the robot operates in. This space is defined as the task space of the robot, denoted as $\mathcal{T}$. Often the structure of this space is unknown --- along with the goal --- and the robot must first explore the world using an exploration and mapping algorithm before deciding on a goal and path.  This paper is instead concerned with a restricted subset of this problem.

Consider a differential drive robot starting at location $(0,0)$, placed in a world with an unknown number of obstacles, that is given the objective to reach position $(x,y)$ in task space without colliding with obstacles. A two-pronged approach can be taken to safe-guard from collisions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plan a path that does not intersect with any obstacles for all future time.
    \item Design a controller that ensures sufficiently fast convergence to the path and provides a guarantee, under reasonable assumptions, that the robot will not leave the path.
\end{enumerate}

Section \ref{sec:planning} covers the techniques used in planning a safe path for all future time. In implementation, planning generally precedes control however in this report the preceding section, Section \ref{sec:control}, concerns itself with controller design. This out-of-order content placement is intended to give the reader a better intuition for the decisions made at planning stage. With this framework in mind, the problem may be stated formally.

\section{Notation}
\nomenclature{$\mathcal{T}$}{Mobile robot task space.}
\nomenclature{$\mathcal{T}_{(w,h)}$}{Rectangular mobile robot task space with width $w$ and height $h$.}
\nomenclature{$\vec{x}$}{A vector in $\R$.}
\nomenclature{$\vec{x}_i$}{The $i$-th component of vector $\vec{x}$}
\nomenclature{$\vec{M}$}{A matrix. Can be assumed real unless stated otherwise.}
\nomenclature{$\vec{M}_{(i,j)}$}{The value at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of matrix $\vec{M}$. The variables may have a $:$ substituted to indicate selection of all values in that dimension, similar to that found in the Matlab grammar.}


\section{Problem Statement}
Let the task space, without loss of generality, be the rectangular space  $\mathcal{T}_{(w,h)} = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2 : 0 \leq x \leq w \wedge 0 \leq y \leq h\}$. For simplicity, consider the kinematic model of a differential drive robot with the combined position and orientation state vector $\vec{x}=\trans{(x,y,\theta)}$. The robot has a forward velocity $v\in\R$, $v>0$ and a controllable turning rate $u:(\vec{x}, t)\to\R$. The kinematic dynamics follow as,
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\vec{x}} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            v~cos(\vec{x}_3)\\
            v~sin(\vec{x}_3)\\
            0
        \end{bmatrix}
        +
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
        u

\end{equation}
